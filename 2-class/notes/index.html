## CSBC 2000 - Essentials of Blockchain Development and Security

### Class 2: Distributed ledger Technology as an Abstraction of Blockchain

*Dhruvin Parikh*

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Recap

* Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, backed by a distributed ledger
* The Bitcoin blockchain uses PoW consensus
* Miners are incentivized to maintain the ledger by miner fees + block rewards (as long as they last)
* Blockchains can be controlled by miner(s) who have more hashing power than the rest of the network

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Class plan

* Blockchain as a state machine
* Understand peculiarities of the Ethereum ecosystem
* Different consensus models
* Contrast DLT from blockchain

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Blockchain Definition

* A blockchain is a “cryptographically secure transactional singleton machine with shared-state.”
  * Cryptographically secure
  * Transactional singleton machine
  * With shared-state

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Ethereum

* Ethereum was developed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications
* Buterin argued that Bitcoin and blockchain could benefit from other applications besides money and needed a scripting language for application development that could lead to attaching real-world assets such as stocks and property, to the blockchain.

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## State

* A program’s state is the collection of events and interactions during the program lifecycle that it stored in some retrievable format
* To bring this to blockchain, the transaction data that is stored on the ledger is the state of the ledger
* *"The "state" in Bitcoin is the collection of all coins (technically, "unspent transaction outputs" or UTXO) that have been mined and not yet spent, with each UTXO having a denomination and an owner"* - Ethereum Whitepaper

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## State

* Vitalik wanted a blockchain that took the concept of state more generally
* Specifically, he wanted for the blockchain state to store arbitrary information
* This way, one could run an app that stores crucial state information on the blockchain as opposed to just UTXO information

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## State Machine

* A state machine describes the lifecycle of a system by defining every possible state it can have (based on its variables) as well as every possible state transition
* In computer science, a state machine refers to something that will read a series of inputs and, based on those inputs, will transition to a new state.
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## State Machine

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Ethereum State Machine

* The Ethereum state machine operates with this underlying principle
* The Genesis block is hence equivalent to a blank state
* Anyone can deploy applications that write content to the Ethereum blockchain, represented as transactions

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Ethereum State Machine

![](./ethereum-state-machine.png)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## The Ethereum Virtual Machine

* We have developed this concept of the Ethereum state machine, it is formally known as the EVM
* It is a "Virtual Machine" as the Ethereum state machine has its own opcodes (just like x86 and ARM/RISC-V)
* This is because apps write arbitrary data onto the Ethereum blockchain, we need a common data format

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Smart Contracts

* It is actually just an EVM state transition!
* Since we have a Virtual Machine with its own bytecode, apps need to convert instructions that they want on the blockchain
* That's why Ethereum developers created a new language: Solidity
* You can describe the logic of "on-chain" state and state transitions using this abstract language
* This gets compiled into EVM opcodes so that they can modify the EVM state

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Ethereum Consensus : GHOST

* "Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree"
* Lots of wasted computation in BTC blockchain
*  *"if miner A mines a block and then miner B happens to mine another block before miner A's block propagates to B, miner B's block will end up wasted and will not contribute to network security"* - Ethereum Whitepaper
* Ethereum initially used PoW, now PoS
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Ethereum Consensus : GHOST

![](./ethereum-consensus-ghost.png)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Ethereum Consensus : GHOST

* *"GHOST solves the first issue of network security loss by including stale blocks in the calculation of which chain is the "longest"; that is to say, not just the parent and further ancestors of a block, but also the stale descendants of the block's ancestor (in Ethereum jargon, "uncles") are added to the calculation of which block has the largest total proof of work backing it"* - Ethereum Whitepaper
* Further, the "uncle" and "nephew" blocks also receive a portion of the block reward
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Gas Costs

* Storing data on the blockchain is expensive
 * Big computational cost for PoW
 * Data is immutable, stored forever
* Every opcode incurred in a state transition of the EVM has a cost represented by "gas"
 * 1 opcode is roughly 1 gas
 * Gas prices are denoted in Gwei, which itself is a denomination of ETH - each Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH (10<sup>-9</sup> ETH).
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Gas Costs
* In blockchains, the miner fee scales with the size of data intended to be stored on the ledger
* As a result, large data (e.g. files) are not directly stored on the blockchain. Rather, a hash is stored on the chain and the data is stored in an immutable, highly available content storage (e.g. Ethereum Swarm, IPFS) which is typically decentralized
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Cons of PoW
* PoW is highly computationally expensive, hence terrible for the environment
* Another pitfall is that it can be quite insecure; with small networks it can (and has been multiple times) be exploited via a 51% attack
</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Cons of PoW
* Plus, it's not really that decentralized

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Proof of Stake
* Proof of Stake serves as a simple modification over PoW that solves these problems
* PoS allows for miners to get a block reward proportional to the amount of currency that they already own

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Proof of Stake
* This way, instead of utilizing energy to answer PoW puzzles, a PoS miner is limited to mining a percentage of transactions that is reflective of his or her ownership stake. For instance, a miner who owns 3% of the Bitcoin available can theoretically mine only 3% of the blocks.
* More hashing power != more mining rewards

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Ethereum 2.0: Gasper, the Friendly GHOST

* In Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake is done with the concept of mining
* Instead, ETH holders who are running a validator node are able to place bets with their Ether
* Each bet represents which block they think will be mined next
* If their bet is correct, they get their stake back plus the block reward 

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Ethereum 2.0: Gasper, the Friendly GHOST

* If they are incorrect, they just get their stake back
* This new system is called the "Beacon Chain"

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Nothing at Stake Problem
* However, validators do not have anything at stake when the network forks; they can simply bet on all the forked chains since they have no incentive mechanism to choose
* Some versions of Gasper punish users who engage in such behavior as it can lead to lack of protection against double spend

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Validator Shuffling
* Validators can be malicious; the Beacon Chain protects against this by assigning validators to commitees
* Committees make decisions on blocks and Gasper ensures that all validators are randomly distributed in such a way that "committees are more or less an accurate statistical representation of the overall validator set"

## Proof Of Spacetime

![](proof-of-spacetime.png)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Proof Of Spacetime

* "The idea of proof-of-capacity is to require network participants to demonstrate a financial interest in the success of the network by allocating some form of memory or disk space towards it"
* Miners have to "seal" data that enters the network and periodically have to "prove" they have the data

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Avalanche

![](avalanche-consensus.png)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Tendermint

* Tendermint is software for securely and consistently replicating an application on many machine
 * works even if up to 1/3 of machines fail in arbitrary ways
 * every non-faulty machine sees the same transaction log and computes the same state
* The ability to tolerate machines failing in arbitrary ways, including becoming malicious, is known as Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Tendermint

* BFT theory is pretty old (late 1970s)
* Blockchain technology is just a reformalization of BFT in a more modern setting

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Byzantine Generals Problem

* Coordination required for system to work

![](byzantine.png)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Tendermint

* Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency blockchain where each node maintains a fully audited Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) database. If one wanted to create a Bitcoin-like system on top of ABCI, Tendermint Core would be responsible for
 * Sharing blocks and transactions between nodes
 * Establishing a canonical/immutable order of transactions (the blockchain)

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Tendermint

* The application will be responsible for 
  * Maintaining the UTXO database
  * Validating cryptographic signatures of transactions
  * Preventing transactions from spending non-existent transactions 
  * Allowing clients to query the UTXO database.
